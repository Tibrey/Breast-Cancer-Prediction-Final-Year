    <div class="logistic">
      This system is developed using the logistic regression. Logistic regression is widely used model in machine
      learning for binary classification.
      It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class. The logistic regression model function
      is represented as:

      <p>
        <span>f</span>(
        <span class="italic">w</span>,
        <span class="italic">b</span>(
        <span class="italic">x</span>
        )
        ) =
        <span class="italic">g</span>(
        <span class="italic">w</span> &middot;
        <span class="italic">x</span> +
        <span class="italic">b</span>
        )
      </p>

      In this equation, fw,b(x) represents the predicted probability,w is the weight vector,bis the bias term, x is the
      input feature vector, and g
      (z) is the sigmoid function:
      <p>
        <span class="italic">g</span>(
        <span class="italic">z</span>
        ) =
        <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1 + e<sup>-z</sup></sub>

        <p>where <code>m</code> is the number of samples, <code>yi</code> is the true label, and <code>fw,b(xi)</code>
          is the predicted probability.</p>
