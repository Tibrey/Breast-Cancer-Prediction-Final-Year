      <button class="accordion">
        What is Breast cancer?
        <i class="bx bx-chevron-down"></i>
      </button>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Breast cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the cells of the
        breast. It is one of the most common cancers affecting women
        worldwide, although it can also occur in men. Breast cancer occurs
        when abnormal cells in the breast grow uncontrollably, forming a
        tumor. These cancerous cells can invade nearby tissues and spread to
        other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system.

      <button class="accordion">
        What features are commonly used in breast cancer prediction models
        <i class="bx bx-chevron-down"></i>
      </button>
      <p class="paragraph">
        This question focuses on the specific attributes or characteristics
        (features) of the data that are commonly considered when building a
        breast cancer prediction model. Common features include mean radius,
        mean texture, mean smoothness, and other measurable characteristics.

      <button class="accordion">
        What machine learning algorithms are commonly used for breast cancer
        prediction
        <i class="bx bx-chevron-down"></i>
      </button>
      <p class="paragraph">
        This question explores the choice of machine learning algorithms.
        Commonly used algorithms include Support Vector Machines (SVM),
        Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural
        Networks. Each algorithm has its strengths and considerations.

      <button class="accordion">
        How do you evaluate the performance of breast cancer prediction model
        <i class="bx bx-chevron-down"></i>
      </button>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Evaluating model performance is crucial. Responses to this question
        might include discussing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall,
        F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve. Additionally, discussing
        the importance of domain-specific considerations is relevant.
